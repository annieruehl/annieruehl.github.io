## Welcome to Annie's Website

Hi, my name is Annie Ruehl. I am currently a senior at The George Washington University studying Journalism and Mass Communication.

### Assignment 1

For this assignment, I organized and filtered data regarding Donald Trump's impeachment trial. 

You can see the assignment [here](https://annieruehl.github.io/hw1/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/annieruehl/annieruehl.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
